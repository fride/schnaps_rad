# gleamy_bike_lend

This is a work in progress, don't expect the code to not be a burning trash fire.

Nonetheless. My idea is to take Christans [ddd-to-the-code](https://github.com/cstettler/ddd-to-the-code-workshop-sample) example and rewrite it. Here in Gleam.

My first experiment will use an event store and implement the entire example with an event sourcing architecture, just because. (I might throw this away and use a normal db?)

stay tuned for more ...
